https://cloudacademy.com/lab/restful-microservices-aws-lambda-api-gateway/?context_resource=lp&context_id=241

Description
Amazon API Gateway allows you to design RESTful interfaces and connect them to your favorite backend. You can design your own resources structure, add dynamic routing parameters, and develop custom authorizations logic. Each API resource can be configured independently, while each stage can have specific cache, throttling, and logging configurations.

This approach is particularly useful when you consider that each request and response can be attached to a custom mapping template, in order to perform custom data manipulation or improve API backward compatibility.

In this Lab, you will see how to define a simple API and how to connect it to AWS Lambda. This provides a nice way to obtain a scalable backend for modern web applications or mobile apps. You will configure custom stages, protect resources with an API key, and explain how to best connect API Gateway stages with AWS Lambda versions and aliases. You will learn about AWS Lambda's basic configuration, monitoring, and versioning as you progress through the Lab.

Lab Objectives
Upon completion of this Lab, you will be able to:

Understand the basics of RESTful APIs
Implement REST APIs using Amazon API Gateway
Enable desirable API features in API Gateway including caching, throttling, CORS, usage plans, and API key access
Create serverless API backends using AWS Lambda functions
Implement best practices for integrating Lambda backends in API Gateway
Lab Prerequisites
You should be familiar with:

Serverless computing fundamentals, particularly AWS Lambda, is beneficial
Prior experience using or implementing REST APIs is beneficial, but not required
